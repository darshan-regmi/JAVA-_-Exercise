# ATM Simulator CLI ‚Äì Java Practice Project

Welcome, budding Java developer! üëã In this mini‚Äìproject you will build a **command-line ATM simulator** consisting of two files: `ATMAccount.java` and `ATMSimulatorCLI.java`. By the end, you will have a tiny banking app you can run from any terminal ‚Äì just like the software that powers real ATM machines (minus the money-spitting hardware).

---

## Why Build This?

* **Real-world relevance** ‚Äì Every time you use an ATM, software very similar to this project is performing deposits, withdrawals, and balance checks.
* **OOP fundamentals** ‚Äì Sharpen your skills with classes, objects, encapsulation, and simple error handling.
* **Instant feedback** ‚Äì A CLI gives immediate input/output, so you can iteratively test each feature.

---

## Quick Demo

```bash
‚ùØ javac ATMSimulatorCLI.java ATMAccount.java # compile the files
‚ùØ java ATMSimulatorCLI # run the CLI
===== ATM Simulator =====
Enter account number (0 to exit): 
>>
```

---

## Prerequisites

* JDK **8+** installed (`java -version` to confirm).
* A terminal / command prompt.
* A text editor or IDE (VS Code, IntelliJ, or even Notepad++ ‚Äì your choice!).

---

## Setup

1. **Clone or download** this repository.
2. Open a terminal *inside the `ATM` folder*.
3. Compile:
   ```bash
   javac ATMAccount.java ATMSimulatorCLI.java
   ```
4. Run:
   ```bash
   java ATMSimulatorCLI
   ```
   That‚Äôs it! You‚Äôre talking to your ATM.

## Step-by-Step Walkthrough

Below is a mentor-style roadmap. Treat each step like a checkpoint ‚Äì compile and run after every change so bugs stay small and friendly.

1. **Create the `ATMAccount` class**  
   - *What you do:* Declare a new class with private fields `accountNumber` and `balance`.  
   - *Real-world analogy:* Think of a bank folder that stores a unique customer number and their current money tally.  
   - *Tips:* Mark fields `private` and add descriptive comments.  
   - *Watch-outs:* Forgetting `private` means anyone can modify balance directly ‚Äì not good for security.

2. **Add a constructor & getters**  
   - *What you do:* Write a constructor accepting an `accountNumber` and an initial `balance`. Provide `getBalance()` and `getAccountNumber()`.  
   - *Analogy:* Opening a fresh bank account with a starting deposit.  
   - *Tips:* Use `this.` to disambiguate field names.  
   - *Common mistake:* Accidentally shadowing fields (`balance = balance;`). Always reference `this.balance`.

3. **Implement `deposit(double amount)`**  
   - *What you do:* Increase `balance` by `amount` **only if** `amount > 0`.  
   - *Analogy:* Sliding bills into the ATM slot; the machine rejects Monopoly money (negative or zero).  
   - *Tips:* Return a boolean to signal success/failure ‚Äì the CLI can then print a friendly message.  
   - *Watch-outs:* Using `==` for floating-point comparisons; prefer `amount <= 0`.

4. **Implement `withdraw(double amount)` with validation**  
   - *What you do:* Decrease `balance` when there is enough money *and* `amount > 0`.  
   - *Analogy:* The ATM checks if your wallet actually contains those bills before handing them over.  
   - *Tips:* Return `false` for insufficient funds and print a concise error message.  
   - *Common mistake:* Updating balance *before* checking funds ‚Äì always validate first!

5. **Add `displayBalance()`**  
   - *What you do:* Simple `System.out.printf` showing the current balance to two decimal places.  
   - *Analogy:* The ATM screen flashing your remaining balance.  
   - *Tip:* Centralising display logic means consistent formatting everywhere.

6. **Design the `ATMSimulatorCLI` main loop**  
   - *What you do:* In `main()`, instantiate an `ATMAccount`, display a numbered menu, and read user input in a `while` loop.  
   - *Analogy:* The never-ending ATM service cycle waiting for the next customer.  
   - *Tips:* Use `Scanner` for input and a `switch` to route actions.  
   - *Common mistake:* Forgetting to close `Scanner` on exit; it‚Äôs polite to release resources.

7. **Wire menu options to account methods**  
   - *What you do:* For each menu number call `deposit`, `withdraw`, or `displayBalance`. Exit gracefully on `4`.  
   - *Analogy:* Pressing physical buttons on an ATM to trigger internal banking operations.  
   - *Tip:* Confirm every action back to the user ‚Äì people like receipts.  
   - *Watch-outs:* Input mismatch exceptions (e.g., user types letters). Wrap `nextDouble()` calls in `try/catch` or use `hasNextDouble()`.

8. **Polish & test edge cases**  
   - *What you do:* Try zero, negative, and overflow amounts. Handle invalid menu numbers.  
   - *Analogy:* Quality-assurance engineers attacking an ATM prototype to break it *before* customers do.  
   - *Tip:* Add log messages for rejected operations.  
   - *Common mistake:* Not resetting the scanner buffer ‚Äì call `nextLine()` after numeric reads.

## Common Errors & Fixes

| Error message | Likely cause | Quick fix |
|---------------|-------------|-----------|
| `java.util.InputMismatchException` | User typed letters where `double` expected | Use `scanner.hasNextDouble()` before reading or catch the exception and prompt again. |
| `Cannot access private field balance` | Trying to use `account.balance` directly | Call `getBalance()` or create a public method inside `ATMAccount`. |
| `symbol not found: Scanner` | Forgot import | Add `import java.util.Scanner;` at the top of `ATMSimulatorCLI.java`. |
| `Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NumberFormatException` | Parsing string to number without validation | Wrap `Double.parseDouble()` in a `try/catch`. |
| Balance becomes negative after withdrawal | Validation logic missing | Before subtracting, check `amount <= balance`. |

## Bonus Extension Ideas

- **Multiple accounts** ‚Äì Store a `Map<Integer, ATMAccount>` and let users ‚Äúinsert‚Äù different cards.
- **PIN authentication** ‚Äì Add security before transactions.
- **Persistence** ‚Äì Save balances to a file or small database so money survives program restarts.
- **Unit tests** ‚Äì Use JUnit to ensure deposits and withdrawals never misbehave.
- **GUI upgrade** ‚Äì Swing or JavaFX for a windowed ATM.

## You Got This! üöÄ

Every successful software engineer started with tiny projects just like this one. Celebrate each bug you squash ‚Äì it means you learned something new today. Keep iterating, keep experimenting, and most importantly **have fun**. The ATM world (and the real one) awaits your next creation!
